Generic single-database configuration.

- if a change is made to the models
    run:
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "changes_description_here"
    This will register the changes in migrations/versions

    then apply the changes to db:
    alembic upgrade head (to the newest or you can specify with the first unique symbols of the migration)

- if you want to reverse changes
    alembic downgrade -1 (specifies how many versions down you want to downgrade)

- if you want to downgrade to beginning
    alembic downgrade base
